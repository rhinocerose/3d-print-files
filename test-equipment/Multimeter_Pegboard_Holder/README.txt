# Summary

Pegboard holder for a Multimeter,

One with the Pegs already in it and one with the pegs as separate parts (good if you just want mounting holes instead)

**Version 2:**
Has the PEGS BUILT IN! and Custom in model SUPPORTS for the pegs!!
Print normally without supports, then brake off the built in support after its done printing.


**Version 1:**
Has the pegs as separate parts, they are a VERY lose fit and are made to be hot glued in place!
The bent pegs are for the top holes, angle them UP. The straight pegs for the bottom

Can fit Meters about 2.5" x 1.75" base.
For pegboard with holes every 1".

Print the holder and the pegs so the base plate is flat on your print bed.

If you make one, post it! Id like to see!
