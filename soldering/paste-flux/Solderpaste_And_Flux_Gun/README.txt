# Summary

This is my version of a 3d printable solder paste and flux gun .

(I have posted a video on YouTube that shows how to assemble
 this solder-paste gun  https://youtu.be/BK9-DYdfV4c   )

A wall mount bracket for this gun you can get here on my Thingiverse page :
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3143835

It is possible to use the the same front adapter plate to both
the small and big syringe ,but it is meant to fit the big syringe ,
i will later make an adapter that fits the small syringe if anybody
want this .
I have tested it with both syringe with solder-paste and flux and
it works perfectly with both ,but of course you will need to use
some more force to press the solder-paste out ,especially when
it has not been used for awhile ,so be careful with the pressure .

I have printed this in Max Pla that should be stronger than normal Pla ,
though this have worked pretty well for me ,i would recommend you
to print this in Abs or at least print the push rod in Abs .
I do not know if this would work with Petg since it tends to be somewhat
flexible .

Parts you need to assemble this gun:

5 x m4 nuts
3 x m4 bolts - 25mm
2 x m4 bolts - 12mm
1 x m4 bolt - 20mm
1 x m3 bolt - 12mm
1 x stiffer spring ....you have to experiment with this
1 x softer spring .... you have to experiment with this

The length of the springs is depending of the type you use ,so
again you need to experiment with this ,sorry for not being able
to give you more specific notes about this .
The two springs i have used was from a large collection i have 
gathered through the years ,maby you can do the same.
