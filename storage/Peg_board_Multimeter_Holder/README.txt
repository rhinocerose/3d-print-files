# Summary

A pegboard holder for the well known DT-830B Digital Multimeter-Voltmeter. It also has a place to store the probes. This holder fits to a standard peg board with 1 inch spacing. The OpenSCAD file is included so you can change the design if you want.

Other pegboard tools which I designed can be found at:
Universal box           http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241017
Screwdriver holder  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1240992

Some people ask for the single screwdriver holder on the picture.
That is not my design but a nice one by twobraids
