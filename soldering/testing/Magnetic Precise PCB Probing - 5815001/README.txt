Summary:
Magnetic Precise PCB ProbingIn addition to PCB vices , I immediately planned to make these probes. I didn't find the ones I wanted. And yes, all the details are very small and require special processing, but the result is worth such an effort.For making probes, I bought stainless steel spring wire. Specifically, in my case, a wire with a diameter of 0.7 mm will be used. For insulation, a heat-shrinkable tube with a diameter of 0.8 mm is used, its shrinkage is almost three times. Attaching the wire to the probes with simple soldering will not work, at least I do not know such a method. I would be grateful if you tell me such a flux or something else. But there are at least two ways out: the first is crimping into terminals; second - pulse welding. I chose the second method, the more there is something to use.Also, the probes must be sharpened. At one time I made this wonderful tool , which I still use today. But you can use what you have. But keep in mind, this is stainless steel, it is difficult to process it :)Magnets are used with a diameter of 9x5mm. The question often arises why I often use this size of magnets ... But the answer is extremely simple - I just have a lot of them. Well, the column (rod) is a carbon fiber rod with a diameter of 4 mm, which is also available. But it is possible from other materials, they are also presented in the list with links.I usually use 28 AWG silicon insulated wires. The diameter of the insulated wires is 1.3mm and they are also very flexible compared to PVC insulation. Connectors - in my case Dupont. Screws M2.5x16mm.The probes are designed in such a way that they have complete freedom of positioning, both in height, length and inclination.PS: Make the length of the probes whatever you want, as you like...See the video for details:  See also:  If you liked this thing - let me know by putting like!Parts links below: Stainless Steel Spring Steel Wire  Heat Shrink Tube  Carbon Fiber Rod D4mm  Glass fiber rod D4mm   Dupont Connector Set  Flexible Silicone Wire 28 AWG  Button Head Screw M2.5  Inserts Nut M2.5  Round Magnet 9x5mm  Universal PCB Board Holder  Magnetic third hand big set  Magnetic third hand small Links to used tools: Bifrc DH20 Handheld Spot Welder  NOGA deburring tool and Blades  Crimping Pliers Tool SN-01BM  Crimping Tool  Crimping tools Pliers For Tube/Sleeve/Needle  Angle grinder Required files: project-files.zip My new machine:          My favorites:  Thank you for every tip or donation,it means great recognition for me and helps a lot to keep going!
