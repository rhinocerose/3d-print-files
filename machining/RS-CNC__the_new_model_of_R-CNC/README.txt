# Summary

The RS-CNC is the replacement of the R-CNC (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2159840)

# How I Designed This

Although at first glance she looks like her big sister, everything has been reviewed and corrected thanks to the community of the forum MakerFr, thank you all for this teamwork.

All this work has made this machine more robust, precise and easier to use!

It allows to machine wood, carbon, aluminum and many other materials ðŸ™‚

Here are the improvements:
Electric / electronic:

    Shield CNC MakerFr developed on the forum, powered directly 24V (shield usable on all CNC)
    3.2â€³ TFT screen
    Nunchuk Wii Joystick for Manual Movement
    Spindle relay for automatic starting and extinguishing
    Endstop switchs
    Emergency stop, reset and front USB port
    Z axis get a Nema23

Mecanichal:

    Square tubes go from 25 to 30mm for more rigidity and allows machine enlargements
    The threaded rods of the dollies go from 6 to 8mm
    Z-axis receives the more rigid and precise MGN12 slides
    Z axis receives ACME rod with anti backlash nut in POM
    All belts have tensioners
    The X axis has through-belts, which reinforces the overall
    Height-adjustable tray for perfect flatness
    Machineable surface gain for the same size (550x570x75mm)

The cost price is only 350/400 â‚¬ !!!

The actual STL files are for:
-18x100 or 20x100mm box screed
-30mm or 1-1/4" square tubes.

In other case, you can build it in wood (MDF, plywood) instead of aluminium box screed if you donâ€™t find it, or if itâ€™s too expensive in your country, the rigidity will be the same because itâ€™s not the material that gets the machine strong but geometry of the whole !
