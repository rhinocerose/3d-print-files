# Summary

Does your work bench have too much junk and too little light?  This fearsome, 36-eyed task lamp puts your junk to work as ballast in the handy storage tray.  It uses four of the ubiquitous 9-LED flashlights (25mm dia), each individually aim-able for broad or spot focus.  The flashlights unclip easily for remote illumination.  Also doubles as a self-lit snack bowl for your upcoming Halloween party!

# Post-Printing

The ball and socket joints should snap together easily.  Work them around until they operate smoothly.  Each socket has  a hole for a 3/8" long 4-40 screw (or 10mm long M3) and nut (9 total).  You can adjust the clamping force on each to get just the right amount of friction to hold the lamp in position.  If the ball joints are sticky or squeaky, give them a little dab of light grease or vaseline.

You'll also need four of the cheap 9-LED flashlights.  I got mine at Harbor Freight (which are sometimes even free with a coupon), but any flashlight with a 25mm dia body should work.
