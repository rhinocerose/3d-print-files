# Summary

<p>This holder can allocate 8 wide USB sticks, 8 SD cards, and up to 15 MicroSD cards.</p>

<p>Ideal for your desk, to keep your portable storage in a single place when you need them.</p>

<p>It has holes to prevent from dust accumulation, and reduce a little the material used to print it.</p>

<p>* This design is an improvement to <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:952885">USB and SD card holder for wide USB sticks</a>; now including better holding for MicroSD at 60 degrees (almost vertical), while extending space for up to 15 (instead of only 5), and fixed some vector errors.</p>

# Print Settings

Printer: RepRap Mendelmax
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.5 mm
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
Printing doesn't need any special adjustment, just print it and enjoy!

Even though it has an upside angle (+60ยบ), shouldn't need any support.

# Post-Printing

## Recommendation

Attach a foamy, or rubbered sheet on the base so it doesn't slip while in your desk, but remember to maintain holes clear.
