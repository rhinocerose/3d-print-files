# Summary

This is a remix of the rubber band PCB vice by Delph27. The main changes are in the base, which has been rounded to help resist warping. It's also got some new cutouts to reduce print time and material, as well as a tightened up channel which should be easier to print on machines which aren't great with overhangs.

The jaws are identical to the originals except for the addition of a little notch to help hold the PCB.

These parts are compatible with the original, so you can use my base with the Delph27's jaws or vice-versa, you can.
